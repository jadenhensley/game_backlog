# Game Backlog using Python

# What is this?

This is a program I wrote to sort my gaming backlog by different metrics according to the howlongtobeatpy API.


# Usage

edit the BACKLOG list variable in backlog.py:

```
BACKLOG = ["Game 1 Here",
"Game 2 Here",
"Game 3 Here",
```


then run:

```
python3 main.py
```

then look at the "output.txt" files generated.

# Installation

Make sure to install dependencies:

```
pip install howlongtobeatpy
```
